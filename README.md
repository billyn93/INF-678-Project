# INF-678-Project
Mock Facebook-like front end pages 
Opiniosphere is is modeled after Facebook but instead is more of a platform for users to share their opinions and find people to discuss them with.
This project wasn't fully functional, it's more of demonstration pages of what the front end could look like for such a concept. A "Post Feed" was removed from
the ProfilePage.html because it incorporated code that was not mine- and I wanted to be ethical.
